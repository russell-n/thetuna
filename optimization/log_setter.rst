Log Setter
==========

This is a module to set the logging level. 


 * Instead of building a class the whole module is used to access the variables and functions within it.

 * By default this module uses the package name with `.log` appended to it as the name of the log-file name.

.. note:: To make it portable this module uses introspection to get the name of the package. This means that it should be at the top-level of the package so that modules in sub-folders can use it.

.. uml::

   log_setter o-- os
   log_setter o-- logging
   log_setter : set_logger(args)
   log_setter : cleanup()

API
---

.. currentmodule:: ape.log_setter

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: api

   set_logger
   cleanup



Cleanup
-------

Since the log-filename is set in this module a `cleanup` function is put here to be accessible outside of the main flow of the system (to allow it to be called even in the event of a crash).

 * A sub-directory is created (default is "last_log")
 * The log is moved to the sub-directory

This function was implemented so the log does not continue to grow even as the code is re-run, but there is at least one copy of the log backed-up.

Example use::

   log_setter.cleanup("output_directory_name")



Setting the Logger
------------------

This is the main function to use. It is intended to be used by the ArgumentParser to create sub-commands so it expects a namespace with command-line arguments as attributes. The logging-level is set according to the following:


.. csv-table:: Setting the Log-Level
   :header: debug,silent,LogLevel

   False,False,Info
   False,True,Error
   True,False,Debug
   True,True,Debug


Example Use::

   log_setter(args)
