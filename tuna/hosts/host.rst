Host
====

A bundle of client and some leftover methods and information. The `Host` builds the connection based on the identified connection type.

.. _host-constants:

Host Constants
--------------

A central place for constants needed by the Host.



.. _host-host:

The Host
--------

There used to be multiple hosts, but now there is one. It uses the connection type to build the other hosts and return them.

.. uml::

   BaseClass <|-- TheHost
   TheHost o- SimpleClient
   TheHost o- TelnetClient


.. currentmodule:: tuna.hosts.host
.. autosummary:: 
   :toctree: api

   TheHost
   TheHost.client
   TheHost.exec_command
   TheHost.close
   TheHost.kill_all



.. _host-enum:

The Host Enum
-------------

A place to store constants that other classes might need to refer to.

::

    class HostEnum(object):
        """
        A holder of Host constants
        """
        __slots__ = ()
    
        # options  
        control_ip = 'control_ip'
        password = 'password'
        connection_type = 'connection_type'
        test_ip = 'test_ip'
        username = 'username'
        port = 'port'
        timeout = 'timeout'

        options = (control_ip, password, connection_type, test_ip, username,
                   port, timeout, prefix, operating_system)
        # defaults
        default_port = 22

    # end HostEnum    
    
    



.. _host-configuration:

The Host Configuration
----------------------

This is a configuration holder for host-configurations. It is created as an Abstract Base Class so that separate `dut` and `server` configurations can be used. They need to inherit from it and set the section name.

.. uml::

   BaseConfiguration <|-- HostConfiguration

.. currentmodule:: tuna.hosts.host
.. autosummary::
   :toctree: api

   HostConfiguration
   HostConfiguration.example
   HostConfiguration.section
   HostConfiguration.control_ip
   HostConfiguration.password   
   HostConfiguration.connection_type
   HostConfiguration.test_ip
   HostConfiguration.prefix
   HostConfiguration.timeout
   HostConfiguration.username
   HostConfiguration.operating_system
   HostConfiguration.kwargs

   HostConfiguration.check_rep



.. csv-table:: HostConfiguration Attributes
   :header: Attribute, Description, Default
   
   control_ip, Hostname for the control interface, None
   password, Login password, None
   connection_type, Type of connection to the device, ssh
   test_ip, Hostname for the test-interface, -
   username, Login username, -
   port, port for the connection, 22
   timeout, timeout for the connection, 1
   prefix, string to prepend to the commands sent to the device, None
   operating_system, name of OS so commands can be altered as needed, linux
