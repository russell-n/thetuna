Oat Bran helps with regular expressions. Names are uppercased to avoid keyword clashes

Formal Definition
-----------------

These are the basic building blocks of regular expressions.

.. csv-table:: Formal Definition
   :header: Name,Symbol

   empty_string,:math:`\varepsilon`
   alternative (OR),:math:`|`
   kleene_star, :math:`*`

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: api

   FormalDefinition.empty_string
   FormalDefinition.alternative
   FormalDefinition.OR
   FormalDefinition.kleene_star



.. _ape-oatbran-groups:

Groups
------

Besides the basic use of grouping with parentheses (to explicitly apply operations to multiple characters, for example), the Group hold perl (`(?<expression>)`) and python (`(?P<expression>)`) group-extensions. Since parentheses have to be symmetric these are applied as methods rather than strings that are added to other strings.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: api

   Group
   Group.group
   Group.named
   Group.not_followed_by
   Group.not_preceded_by
   Group.preceded_by
   Group.followed_by



.. _ape-oatbran-quantifiers:

Quantifiers
-----------

Quantifiers are used to describe repetitions of patterns. The `zero_or_more` quantifier is an alias for the `FormalDefinition.kleene_star`. Although I usually think of these as suffixes, the exact and m-to-n versions need braces so the quantifiers are applied as methods to make their use uniform. I use the string `format` method so they will not raise errors if passed non-strings as patterns.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: api

   Quantifier
   Quantifier.one_or_more
   Quantifier.zero_or_more
   Quantifier.zero_or_one
   Quantifier.exactly
   Quantifier.m_to_n



.. _ape-oatbran-character-classes:

Character Classes
-----------------

A helper with character classes (stuff put in square-brackets ('[]')). There are some similar patterns in other classes. I tried to put single characters in this class (e.g. digit) and multiple characters or those with quantifiers in other classes (e.g. digits or optional_digits).

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: api

   CharacterClass
   CharacterClass.character_class
   CharacterClass.alpha_num
   CharacterClass.alpha_nums
   CharacterClass.digit
   CharacterClass.non_digit
   CharacterClass.non_zero_digit
   CharacterClass.character_class
   CharacterClass.not_in
   


.. _ape-oatbran-boundaries:

Boundaries
----------

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: api

   Boundaries
   Boundaries.string_start
   Boundaries.string_end
   Boundaries.word
   Boundaries.string
   


.. _ape-oatbran-common-patterns:

Common Patterns
---------------

These are pattens that I use a lot but I could not think of where to put them.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: api

   CommonPatterns.anything
   CommonPatterns.everything
   CommonPatterns.letter
   CommonPatterns.letters
   CommonPatterns.optional_letters
   CommonPatterns.space
   CommonPatterns.spaces
   CommonPatterns.optional_spaces
   CommonPatterns.not_space
   CommonPatterns.not_spaces
   


.. _ape-oatbran-numbers:

Numbers
-------

The numbers are broken up into types based on those listed `here <http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CountingNumber.html>`_. I was originally using the more `traditional number types <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_types_of_numbers>`_ but I keep forgetting which ones have zero in them so I will work with just positive/negative, non-positive/non-negative, and integer/real.

.. csv-table:: Numbers
   :header: Name,Description,Symbol
   :delim: ;

   positive_integer; :math:`1,2,\ldots`;:math:`\mathbb{Z}^+`
   non_negative_integer; :math:0,1,\ldots` ; :math:`\mathbb{Z}^*`
   non_positive_integer; :math:0, -1, -2,\ldots`;
   integer;positive, negative, 0; :math:`\mathbb{Z}`
   real_number;Positive,negative, 0;:math:`\mathbb{R}`

   
.. warning:: The integers are allowed to match even when surrounded by punctuation. This makes it okay for sentences and csvs, etc. but means that if given a floating point number it will match the substring to the left of the decimal point (e.g. 10.00213 will match 10).

.. warning:: Along with the previous warning it should be noted that `nonnegative_integer` extracts the non-negative portion, it does not ignore negative integers. So if you have -300, the match will be 300. This may change once I start using this, but for now that is the behavior (useful for extracting ranges, maybe -- nonnegative_integer + '-' + nonnegative_integer):

.. note:: `real` is treated as a super-set that matches floats or integers.
