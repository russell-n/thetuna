The Tuna Plugin

.. _tuna-plugin:
This is the plugin that creates the master composite to run other :ref:`Composites <composite-class>`. It will be used when the `run` subcommand is called by the user.

.. _tunaplugin-components:

The Components
--------------
    
.. uml::

   Component --|> BaseClass
   Composite --|> Component
   Leaf --|> Component
   Hortator --|> Composite
   Operator --|> Composite
   Operation --|> Composite
   Hortator "1" o- "1..*" Operator
   Operator "1" o- "1..*" Operation
   Operation "1" o- "1..*" Leaf

The `Hortator`, `Operator` and `Operation` are instances of the Composite and so aren't functionally different but they catch different levels of exceptions so that there can be a certain level of self-recovery and error handling. Each execution of the `tuna` have one `Hortator` composed of `Operators` (one `Operator` per configuration file with a `TUNA` section). Each line in the TUNA will correspond to an `Operation` composed of `Leafs` (one `Leaf` per item on the comma-separated line). Each Leaf is a plugin's product. Thus when a plugin is created, the product should inherit from the `Component` class in order to make sure it has the same interface.

The reason for differentiating the three Composites is to allow different levels of error handling.  For instance, differentiating `Operation` vs  `Operator`  allows the user to decide on a set of plugins that will be called even if the first set crashes. e.g.::

    [TUNA]
    op_1 = WatchRSSI,IperfSession
    op_2 = CleanUp

When translated to objects, this configuration would create one `Operation` composite for each line and both lines would be composed in an `Operator` (and if there are multiple config-files with ``[TUNA]`` sections, an `Operator` will be created for each and all `Operators` will be composed in the `Hortator`). If one of the `Leafs` in `op_1` (`WatchRSSI` or `IperfSession`) crashes in a predictable way (raising a `TunaError` or the equivalent) then the `op_2` Leaf (CleanUp) should still be executed. The reason for only catching tuna-defined exceptions is so that if something is really wrong with the code or system and another exception is raised (either a python-built-in exception or from an external third-party package), it will be assumed that the configuration is un-runnable and the Hortator will move on to the next `Operator`.

.. _tunaplugin-errors:

The Errors
----------

.. uml::

   TunaError --|> Exception
   DontCatchError --|> Exception

Since the two errors are siblings, catching the ``TunaError`` won't catch the `DontCatchError`.

.. '   

 * The `Operation` composite runs its `Leafs` and lets the errors propagate (so any errors will stop it)

 * The `Operator` runs its `Operations` and traps `TunaErrors` so that it can try all its `Operations`, allowing any clean-up `Leafs` to be run

 * The `Hortator` runs its `Operators` and traps all errors (except KeyboardInterrupts), preventing one `Operator` from stopping the others

.. _tunaplugin-run-state-diagram:
 
The Run State Diagram
---------------------

The assumed flow for the ``run`` sub-command is something like this:

.. digraph:: run_state_diagram

   rankdir = LR
   pa [label="Parse Args"]
   bc [label="Build Map"]
   bo [label="Build Composites"]
   run [label="Run", shape=diamond]
   data [label="Data", shape=rect]
   start [label="Start", shape=diamond]
   configurations [label="Configurations", shape=rect]
   
   start -> pa [label="args"]
   pa -> bc [label="name"]
   configurations -> bc [label="config"]
   bc -> bo [label="map"]
   bo -> run [label="Hortator"]
   run -> data [label="datum"]


This means:
   
 * The `Parse Args` state has been reached before this plugin is created.

 * The `Build Map` uses a `ConfigurationMap <configuration-map>`

 * the `Build Composites` happens in creating the ``product``

.. _tunaplugin-external-plugins:

Using External Plugins
----------------------

In order to allow the execution of plugins that are not a part of the ``ape``, I am allowing the declaration of 
modules in the configuration file::

    [MODULES]
    package.module

Or something similar. The ape will search modules named in the MODULES section for children of the `ape.plugins.base_plugin.BasePlugin` class and load and call them if found. The idea is that rather than having to mix up the ape and other packages, a `sandbox` package can be setup with plugins that act as the interface between the `ape` and the other package(s).

Using the `FakePlugin` created for the :ref:`Exploring External Imports <exploring-external-imports>` section, the config file for the ape could look something like this::

    [TUNA]
    operation_1 = FakePlugin

    [MODULES]
    fakepackage.fakeplugin

    [FakePlugin]
    plugin = FakePlugin
    option = value

The FakePlugin returns a :ref:`DummyClass <dummy-class>` as its `product` so the FAKEPLUGIN section doesn't really do anything.

.. '

.. note:: In order to allow more than one instance of a plugin to be created, the ``plugin=<plugin class name>`` line was added. Each section that configures a plugin needs it. The header for the section is arbitrary but must match the value defined in the APE section.

If we wanted to configure a second FakePlugin, for instance, we could do something like this::

    [APE]
    operation_1 = apple, banana

    [MODULES]
    fakepackage.fakeplugin

    [apple]
    plugin = FakePlugin
    option = value

    [banana]
    plugin = FakePlugin
    options = other_value
 
This is the intended way for it to work, anyway. If the plugin wasn't built to use the ``section_header`` attribute when retrieving section information it won't work.
